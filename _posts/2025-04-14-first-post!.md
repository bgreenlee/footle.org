I’m building an iOS app that will make it easy to post to any GitHub-based blog (like this one) from iOS/iPadOS. I’ve finally got the basic pieces together to do an actual post from my phone, and this is it!

My next step is to set up a Sharing Extension so you can write your post in any app (like Apple Notes) and just share to post.

Right now the app just supports Jekyll, but it should be easy to adapt to support any GitHub-based workflow.
